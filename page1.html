      God of War is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio
      and published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). First released on
      March 22, 2005, for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) console, it is the first
      installment in the series of the same name and the third chronologically.
      Loosely based on Greek mythology, it is set in ancient Greece with
      vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist
      Kratos, a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian Gods. The goddess Athena
      tasks Kratos with killing Ares, the God of War and Kratos' former mentor
      who tricked Kratos into killing his wife and daughter. As Ares besieges
      Athens out of hatred for Athena, Kratos embarks on a quest to find the one
      object capable of stopping the god once and for all: Pandora's Box. The
      gameplay of God of War focuses on combo-based combat, achieved through the
      player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and a secondary weapon acquired
      later in the game. It features quick time events that require the player
      to complete various game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat
      stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks
      and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options. It also
      features puzzles and platforming elements. God of War sold more than 4.6
      million copies worldwide, making it the fourteenth best-selling
      PlayStation 2 game of all time. Regarded as one of the best
      action-adventure games for the platform, it won several "Game of the Year"
      awards. In 2009, entertainment website IGN named God of War the
      seventh-best PlayStation 2 game of all time. It has been highly praised
      for its graphics, sound, story, and gameplay and has been cited as one of
      the greatest video games ever made. The success of the game led to the
      development of seven more games and expansion into other media. The game
      and its first sequel, God of War II, were remastered and released in
      November 2009 as part of the God of War Collection, and in 2012, the
      remastered version was re-released as part of the God of War Saga, both
      for the PlayStation 3 (PS3). A novelization of the game was published in
      May 2010. A film adaptation had been in development for many years but was
      ultimately canceled.
