        God of War is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio
        and published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). First released on
        March 22, 2005, for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) console, it is the first
        installment in the series of the same name and the third
        chronologically. Loosely based on Greek mythology, it is set in ancient
        Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the
        protagonist Kratos, a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian Gods. The
        goddess Athena tasks Kratos with killing Ares, the God of War and
        Kratos' former mentor who tricked Kratos into killing his wife and
        daughter. As Ares besieges Athens out of hatred for Athena, Kratos
        embarks on a quest to find the one object capable of stopping the god
        once and for all: Pandora's Box. The gameplay of God of War focuses on
        combo-based combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—the Blades
        of Chaos—and a secondary weapon acquired later in the game. It features
        quick time events that require the player to complete various game
        controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and
        bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a
        power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options. It also features
        puzzles and platforming elements. God of War sold more than 4.6 million
        copies worldwide, making it the fourteenth best-selling PlayStation 2
        game of all time. Regarded as one of the best action-adventure games for
        the platform, it won several "Game of the Year" awards. In 2009,
        entertainment website IGN named God of War the seventh-best PlayStation
        2 game of all time. It has been highly praised for its graphics, sound,
        story, and gameplay and has been cited as one of the greatest video
        games ever made. The success of the game led to the development of seven
        more games and expansion into other media. The game and its first
        sequel, God of War II, were remastered and released in November 2009 as
        part of the God of War Collection, and in 2012, the remastered version
        was re-released as part of the God of War Saga, both for the PlayStation
        3 (PS3). A novelization of the game was published in May 2010. A film
        adaptation had been in development for many years but was ultimately
        canceled.
